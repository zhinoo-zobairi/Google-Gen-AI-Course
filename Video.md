### Kaggle Notebooks = Ephemeral File System

Even though ChromaDB is technically a persistent database, it only stays persistent if the directory it writes to (e.g., ./chroma_storage/) is itself persistent.

In Kaggle:
- The local disk (/kaggle/working/) is wiped after the notebook stops. Kaggle runs your notebook in a temporary virtual machine
- In that VM:
    - "./" = /kaggle/working/
    - So my ./chroma_storage/ = /kaggle/working/chroma_storage/

### BUT as soon as the session ends, everything inside /kaggle/working/ is deleted. That means ./chroma_storage is not really persistent unless you:
  - Export it manually
  - Save it into a Kaggle dataset
  - Or move to local development

### I don’t need FAISS anymore — my Chroma is using Rust-based ANN, which is very fast.
### Why Not Just Use “Exact” Search?
	•	Exact nearest neighbor search is slow for large corpora:
	•	Say you have 100,000 embeddings, each with 768 dimensions.
	•	A brute-force search checks cosine similarity against all 100k every time you query.
	•	This is O(n \cdot d) time — not scalable.

That’s where ANN comes in:
It uses data structures like trees, graphs, or hashing to:
	•	Preprocess the data
	•	Organize vectors in a way that makes searching much faster
	•	Return the “probably close” neighbors, not always the exact ones

The trade-off is: Speed ↔ Accuracy

You get massive speedups (10x–1000x) with minor accuracy loss, often negligible in practice.

### But when we are retrieving top 3 it means it is already the most similars . Why do we care about a threshold?


“If we’re already retrieving the top 3, aren’t they already similar?”

Yes… they are the most similar, but not necessarily similar enough.

Here’s the key distinction:

Myth	Truth
Top-3 results = good matches	Top-3 just means “closest among the dataset”, even if they’re still far
Cosine distance of top-1 is always low	Sometimes top-1 has distance 0.65 — that’s barely relevant
ANN search guarantees good results	It guarantees proximity, not semantic accuracy

Real Example

Let’s say your MedQuAD corpus doesn’t cover a user’s question topic (e.g., “lupus in teenagers”).

And Chroma gives you this (cosine distances):

Rank	Doc	Distance
1	“What is vitamin D?”	0.61
2	“Causes of fatigue?”	0.64
3	“What is diabetes?”	0.68

Yes, they are the top 3, but they are all far from the query in vector space.

→ So your bot would retrieve irrelevant context and hallucinate confidently.

⸻

That’s Why the Threshold Matters

It acts like a semantic quality gate:
	•	“Only include this document if it’s close enough to the query.”
	•	This improves:
	•	Groundedness
	•	Faithfulness
	•	Fallback logic

### Connect the dots and understand the engine beneath the retrieval. 

- ANN = the overall problem and technique: “Find the nearest neighbors efficiently, even if it’s not exact.”
- HNSW = one specific algorithm used to solve that problem. It’s popular because it balances speed and accuracy well.
- Rust backend = Chroma’s high-performance implementation of HNSW in Rust, faster than its old Python version.
- ChromaDB = your interface and orchestration layer — it wraps ANN search, metadata, persistence, and retrieval into one developer-friendly tool.

> So yes — ANN is the general category, and HNSW (in Rust) is your specific tool for making it lightning fast inside Chroma.

### why should I fine-tuning parameters of HNSW
We use an HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index to perform approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for a given embedding. In this context, Recall refers to how many of the true nearest neighbors were retrieved.
